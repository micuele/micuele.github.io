    <h1>When politician will be robots</h1>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Robots, for the majority of people, are an extension of themselves, meaning that they cannot actually see a robot being better than themselves. The lack of creativity and fear-based bias puts blinkers on one's perspective, limiting their ability to see beyond their preconceived notions.</p>
        
	<p>As humans, we will gift robots our trust.</p>

        <p>They will bring objectivity to a world full of uncertainty because of their determinism.</p>
<p>And one day, this will happen:</p>
<p><b>Guy who just turned 18:</b> "Hi, I don't know who to vote for in the election. Can you give me some advice?"</p>
<p><b>AI of the future:</b> "Sure! Since you read the Communist Manifesto and describe yourself as socialist, you might want to consider voting for [Name of a politician]."</p>
<p>Or, in the worst case:</p>
<p><b>AI of the future:</b> "Vote for [Name of a politician]."</p>
<p><b>The 18-year-old:</b> "How do I justify it to my friends and family?"</p>
